    "At higher T, droplets grow faster, because there is more absolute humidity. Larger drops grow more slowly. At 15 microns, droplets start to fall and collisions help to grow droplets (collision coalescence, sticking efficiency). Collection efficiency is product of coalescence and collision efficiency. Collision efficiency is lower than one, when small particles \"flow around\" the collecting hydrometeor. \\\n",
    "In warm clouds, collision coalescence dominates precipitation formation. \\\n",
    "Over the continents, almost all precipitation goes through the ice phase, except for the subtropics. Warm rain is almost absent anywhere else, or only leads to drizzle. For ice nucleation to happen, an energy barrier depending on size has to be overcome. Homogeneous freezing of cloud droplets happen at <-38°C. Solution droplets of dilute acid solution can first swell and then freeze. Homogenoeus deposition nucleation from vapour does not happen (needs rel. hum. of ca. 8). Ice nucleating particles like mineral dust reduce the energy barrier for new phase formation by providing a surface for water to condense and freeze on (see spherical cap model). Cloud seedlings: Silver iodide AgI with similar crystal structure to ice. In a mixed phase cloud, saturation pressure over ice is higher than over liquid water. So there is supersat. wrt ice but subsatur. wrt to liquid. Therefore droplets and ice crystals together are not happy, the ice grows at the expense of liquid drops. This is called Wegener-Bergeron-Findeisen process.The ice physe is complicated (columns, dendrites, needles, plates, ...)"
